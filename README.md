## Full Stack Development

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Run `npm install` to download the dependancies
3. Write all your backend code in `app.js`, your frontend files should all live in the `Public` folder
4. Run your server locally either by running `nodemon server.js` or `npm run serve` in the terminal
5. Run the automated tests with either `npm run test` or with the `Jest Test Explorer` VSCode Extension

### Don't forget to commit and push frequently


### Requirements
- Backend code written in JavaScript using Node and Express which exposes the endpoints detailed in server.test.js
- Database using NeDB
- Frontend code using HTML, JavaScript, and/or CSS (or additional frontend tools like Vue, Tailwind, etc) which queries and displays data from the server and allows the user to interact with the data (eg adding or deleting records)
